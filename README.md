# Magic Bitboards 4x8


Fork from [magic-bitboards-demo](https://github.com/analog-hors/magic-bitboards-demo) and modify bitboard size to 4x8. Used for chinese dart chess.

--------------------------------

Example code for [my magic bitboard article](https://analog-hors.github.io/writing/magic-bitboards/). Many components are simplified implementations derived from [`cozy-chess`](https://github.com/analog-hors/cozy-chess), my move generation library.

`cargo run --release --bin magic-gen` runs a magic generation program.

`cargo run --release --bin magic-demo` runs a simple demo that uses those magic numbers.
